     In this project I learned how to remove and add a view controller.
     After deleting a view controller, the newly added view controller must be set
         as the initial view from the attributes inspector
     View controllers can also be integrated into a Navigation Controller that way getting back to a previous screen can be handled automatically instead of adding ojbects to every view to control the navigation of control
     Keep in mind that when a navigation view controller is added to the storyboard you must remove the table view controller as well
     Also, you must identify a root view controller for the navigation controller to start in after doing the ctrl + drag
